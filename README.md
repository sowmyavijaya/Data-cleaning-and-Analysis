# Data-cleaning-and-Analysis
Employee separation data analysis

In this project, we work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.
Aim of the project is to answer the following question:
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the dete_survey.csv:

ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
SeparationType: The reason why the person's employment ended
Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended
DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE
Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the tafe_survey.csv:

Record ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
Reason for ceasing employment: The reason why the person's employment ended
LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years): The length of the person's employment (in years)

At the end, we have completed:
* Exploring the data and figuring out how to prepare it for analysis
* Correcting some of the missing values
* Dropping any data not needed for our analysis
* Renaming our columns
* Verifiying the quality of our data
* Creating a new institute_service column
* Cleaning the Contributing Factors columns
* Creating a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
* Combining the data
* Cleaning the institute_service column
* Handling the missing values in the dissatisfied column
* Aggregating the data
